### Project Overview

This project is part of the **Larsen & Toubro** internship initiative, specifically focusing on fine-tuning a **Gemini-based model** for engineering code standardization using **semantic search**. The goal is to create a highly efficient and scalable system to standardize and organize codes related to various engineering activities, enhancing the overall efficiency of engineering processes.

### Problem Statement

In large-scale engineering operations, such as those handled by Larsen & Toubro, there are numerous codes, procedures, and documentation standards across different departments and projects. These codes often lack uniformity, leading to confusion, inefficiency, and errors in the workflow. The existing methods of searching and organizing these codes are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to inaccuracies.

### Solution Approach

The project employs a **Gemini-based fine-tuning model** to address this challenge by implementing an intelligent system for **semantic search**. The semantic search will enable engineers to search for relevant codes and activities based on their contextual meaning, rather than exact keywords. This allows for more intuitive and accurate results, facilitating smoother workflows and reducing the time spent on searching for information.

### Technologies Used
- **Gemini Model**: A powerful language model capable of understanding and processing engineering-related terminologies.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The model uses NLP techniques to comprehend and classify engineering activities based on their semantic meaning.
- **Fine-Tuning**: The model has been customized and fine-tuned for the specific engineering and operational needs of Larsen & Toubro.
- **Regression-Modeling**: Previous project data along with the now standardized codes are used to predict duration for future upcoming projects.
